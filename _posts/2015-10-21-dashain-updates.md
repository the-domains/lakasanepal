LakasaNepal [‪\#‎RebuildNepal‬][0] wishes everyone involved in the project a happy Dashain. We feel happy to know in our hearts that more than 375 families had a roof over their head for the monsoon and for the festivals,  all because of your kindness.

We are now preparing to help 2 VDCs in Dolakha with some shelter relief as well as build two permanent schools in Sindhupalchowk.

To find out how you can help, please contact us via our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/lakasanepal
